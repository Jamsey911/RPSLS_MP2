-  ### Main Page.

![Header Bar](docs/features/main-page.df.JPG)

Below the navbar is the main game play area. This has the scoreboard clearly defined at the top of the page and the player feedback section immediately below. The game icons are laid out beneath that and they are animated to clearly show the user which one they are engaging with. The rules and how to play the game are in the box below giving the user clear instructions on how to play. This is finished off with a clickable animated icon which enables the user to get in touch with feedback or suggestions. 

There are two alternatives to the game screen when the game is either won or lost. The dialogue boxes are coloured appropriately depending on the scenario and the text is either celebratory or comiseratory.
