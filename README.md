-  ### Main Page.

![Header Bar](docs/features/main-page.df.JPG)

The main game area is displayed below the header. It has 4 elements, the Rules, Scoreboard, Results and the Selections. The Rules is displayed in the top left with an easy to read listed format. The Scoreboard is displayed centraly to give the user clear indication of the users score compared to the computers score. The Result section is displayed in the top right to give the user the display of the selections selected. And the Selections are displayed below in which these are the icons displayed for the user to select in order to interact with the game. 

The Selections screen has two alternatives when a game is completed in which the selections are removed for a breif moment and replaced with a display based on the result of the game.A green display is created when the user wins and a red display when the user has lost.

<!-- These colours provide a high level of contrast for users with impaired vison, as confirmed in the testing section below. They also add to the overall goal of creating a clear, engaging and fun design ethos. The colors were chosen in conjunction with the background image to present a smooth, related connection across the application. This helps provide consistency to the overall aesthetic flow of the user experience.

- ## Font.
  The font used for the page is Amatic SC. It is a simple but effective hand drawn webfont. It was initially designed by Vernon Adams, and concieved of to be used freely across the internet. It features both Latin and Hebrew alphabets. The Latin was initially designed by Vernon Adams. The Hebrew was designed by Ben Nathan, who also revised the Latin design. Thomas Jockin respaced and kerned the whole font. -->
